# stutter

need to add
- video setup
- camera iinitialization
- recording actual stutters
- exporting a new video based on stutters
- getting camera auth/photo library auth


i decided this time around to try and implement the UI almost in it's entirety before moving on to the backend implementation.

the backend in this case is all the camera stuff.

i think actually creating the edits might be difficult.
